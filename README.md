# customer_analysis and Customer Activity Recognition(CAR)
In first dataset, each row represents a customer and his activity (how many phone conversations he had, how many times he downloaded a product brochure, how many times he visited the company website, etc.). The last column says if he eventually purchased the product or not. 

data preprocessing & visualization complete!

train-validation split performed

random-forest classifier trained (75% accuracy)

Neural Network implemented (68% accuracy)

ensemble-learning implemented (68% accuracy)

In second dataset, it tracks each user's activity over a period of 8 days and eventually does he buy the product or not

LSTM network built for CAR with 69% accuracy having 3 LSTM layers

LSTM network built by combining static info of customer with his sequential interaction. 75% accuracy achieved!
